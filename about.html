    <h2>The Past, Present & Future</h2>

    <p> Mya was born in Cambridge, Nebraska in the afternoon of August 2, 1999. She was the oldest of three girls, and of all the grandkids. Born in a working-class family, life had never been easy. Her family had always expected the most of her at an early age after the younger children had started being born. As she got older, and more started to be expected from her, she turned away from her family and started rebelling. From getting into trouble at home, then in trouble in school. Getting into the wrong crowd, letting her grades suffer, and skipping school. Toward the end of her high school career, she was in a troubled relationship, which her parents had forbidden. She still managed to graduate high school with her classmates, only barely. The day she turned eighteen, she moved out of the house and had no contact with her family, which turned very dark and dangerous very quickly. Not only did she struggle with being homeless for months before she decided to finally ask for help, but she had struggled with anorexia and depression, but also trying to survive in conditions most could not. Her family gladly took her back a couple of years later after her ex tried to end her life, she struggled with PTSD, and so she started getting her life together and working to be someone she could be proud of. From getting healthy and working on a way she could live with herself and what had happened to her. In 2019, she moved to North Platte, Nebraska to build a life of her own in which no one could control her life. Although, it was not easy, and she spent many years trying to become stable. Struggling to keep food on her plate and pay her bills. Now in the present day, not only did she manage to get into a nice house, and get a car of her own, she found a life partner that is showing her how it feels to be loved. She is finally taking the steps to go to college to become a psychologist for troubled teens and young adults. She has made it her mission to help those who do not have the resources to help themselves. It has been a long road, with plenty of mistakes to finally find a purpose in life to stay alive for the sake of helping others, but at the end of the day she is here to share her story in hopes of saving someoneâ€™s life. To show, even if everything is stacked against you, you can do anything you set your mind to.</p>
